# Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-NYC
Data Science Web App using Streamlit and Python.
### Description: 
This is a Web App that uses Streamlit and Python to display the Motor Vehicle Collisions in New York City.
No knowledge of HTML and CSS is used while making this project. 
Streamlit offers us to make web apps seamlessly with python.
We use various different libararies like pandas, numpy, pydeck, plotly and streamlit.

In this project, we first take a data set which contains all our data to be displayed, and standardize the data.

Then we load the data and visualize it on a map. This involves plotting the filtered data on the 3D interactive map.

We have also used charts and histogram which enables the user to view the data efficiently with the help of dropdowns.

Remember, the user also has the option to view the RAW DATA with the help of a checkbox at the bottom of the page. 

#### Note: The data set was taken by New York Police Department and only contains data between 2012-2020. 
#### Data Source: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95

### Execution:
To execute this web app on your respective device, kindly install the necessary libraries from requirements.txt from the repository.

Also remember to change the location of the .csv file in the source code.

Use command streamlit run "file name".py to run via command prompt.

### Thank You
